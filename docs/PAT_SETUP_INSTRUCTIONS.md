# Setting Up AUTOMATION_PR_TOKEN — PAT Setup Guide

This guide covers what the `AUTOMATION_PR_TOKEN` secret is, how to set it up if it doesn't already exist, and how to verify it's working.

---

## Why This Is Needed

GitHub Actions creates issues using `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default, which shows the author as **github-actions[bot]**. This is deprioritized by GitHub's recommendation algorithm. By using your own Personal Access Token (PAT), issues, comments, reactions, and git commits appear to come from your **real personal account**, which GitHub weights more heavily.

Backlog updates are committed via auto-created PRs that your account creates and merges automatically — giving your account real repo activity.

## Do You Already Have This Set Up?

Check if `AUTOMATION_PR_TOKEN` already exists at:  
**https://github.com/lingdojo/kana-dojo/settings/secrets/actions**

- **If it's there** → check that it was created with **Issues: Read and write** permission (see table in Step 1). If it was originally set up only for PR merging, it may be missing this permission. If so, regenerate the token with the full permission set below and update the secret.
- **If it's not there** → follow Step 1 and Step 2 below.

> **Note:** Reactions, labels, and welcome comments require `Issues: Read and write`. Without this, those operations will silently fail. The workflow now uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a fallback for labels/reactions/comments, so issues will still be labeled correctly — but verifying the PAT has full permissions ensures the issue author also appears as your personal account on all activity.

## Step 1 — Create a Personal Access Token (Fine-Grained)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new**  
   *(Or: Profile Photo → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token)*

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Token name:** anything (e.g. `kana-dojo automation`)
   - **Expiration:** `No expiration` *(or 1 year — set a reminder if so)*
   - **Resource owner:** `lingdojo` *(your organization)*
   - **Repository access:** `Only select repositories` → choose **`kana-dojo`**

3. Under **Repository permissions**, set the following:
   | Permission | Level |
   |---|---|
   | Contents | **Read and write** |
   | Issues | **Read and write** |
   | Metadata | Read (auto-set) |
   | Pull requests | **Read and write** |

4. Click **Generate token** at the bottom.

5. **IMPORTANT: Copy the token immediately.** It looks like `github_pat_XXXXXXXX...`. You will NOT be able to see it again after leaving the page.

## Step 2 — Add the Secret to the Repository

1. Go to: **https://github.com/lingdojo/kana-dojo/settings/secrets/actions**

2. Click **New repository secret**.

3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `AUTOMATION_PR_TOKEN`  ← must be exactly this
   - **Secret:** paste the token you copied in Step 1

4. Click **Add secret**.

---

## Verification

After deploying, verify it's working by:
1. Manually triggering the `hourly-community-issue` workflow in the **Actions** tab
2. Checking that the newly created issue shows **your username** as the author (not `github-actions[bot]`)
3. Checking that a PR titled `chore(automation): update community backlog` was created and auto-merged by your account

---

## Token Expiry Reminder

If you chose an expiration date, set a calendar reminder before it expires. When it expires, generate a new token and update the secret value at the same URL (the name stays the same).
